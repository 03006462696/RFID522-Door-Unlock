/* Arduino RC522 RFID Door Unlocker
 * 
 * Credits
 * Idea based on PCMOFO's project
 * http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-RFID-Door-Lock/
 *
 * MFRC522 Library from miguelbalboa
 * https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid
 * 
 * And helpful code converting UIDs to String from maGo
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22646357/how-to-get-picc-serial-number-on-arduino
 *
 * I have not personally asked for permission to use code from them
 * or how to license this work.
 * 
 * "PICC" short for Proximity Integrated Circuit Card (RFID Tags)

/* Servos can lock and unlock door locks
 * There are examples out there
 * May be we want to use a servo

/* For visualizing whats going on hardware

#define redLed 5
#define greenLed 8

//define buzzer ? maybe we want that

/* We need to define some boolean ???
 * and string ??? bytes ??
 *
 * I think it is not secure to only use PICC's UID
 * to verify PICC's user who wants to unlock a door
 * MFRC522 Library also let us to use some authentication
 * mechanism, writing blocks and reading back
 * and there is great example piece of code
 * about reading and writing PICCs
 * here > http://makecourse.weebly.com/week10segment1.html
 * If you serious about coding and security
 * you should really check MÄ±fare's datasheet
 * We going to use completely INSECURE way to
 * Unlock a door. Also there are always security
 * issues if there is a "LOCK" actually.
